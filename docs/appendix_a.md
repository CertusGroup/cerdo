# Appendix - Glossary

**basic formal ontology (BFO).** top- or upper-level ontology consisting of continuant and occurrent entities used as a model for creating derivative domain and application ontologies.

**continuant.** An entity that continues or persists through time. This is one of the two highest categories (universals) in BFO.

**data profiling.** A data engineering approach through which data is examined and described in order to expedite normalization, transformation, and use in domain modeling and data analysis.

**domain ontology.** An ontology, often from a subject-matter expert, which defines a collection of specific entities, within a community or discipline, using classes or types for that area of knowledge.

**dyad.** The most fundamental unit of analysis in a network and is composed of an edge terminated by two nodes.

**edge.** An element that connects nodes in an undirected graph. In a directed graph, an edge is called an arc.

**entity.** Anything that exists. In terms of BFO domain ontology building, particular or instance entities are created in compliance with the upper-level universal entity collection standards.

**graph databases.** A type of database allowing on one or more connections between two or more entities with multiple dimensions shared by and between each other.

**hypergraph.** A type of graph sees both nodes and edges as entities that can connect to and between one another, meaning edges can connect to each other and can share properties in the same manner.

**knowledge engineering.** The application of upper-level ontologies, information structures, and data to build knowledge systems.

**knowledge gaps.** The absence of entities within a knowledge graph which potentially exist due to indications found in existing structural connections.

**knowledge graph.** A data object comprised of nodes and edges, derived from an ontology model, populated using a knowledge schema.

**knowledge schema.** The directions through which knowledge graph is populated with entities and how those entities are connected to processed data from which the graphâ€™s representational entities were derived.

**link.** See **edge**.

**logical knowledge model.** A system in which data elements are reviewed for their associations with one or more entity representations.

**monohierarchy.** In a hierarchy where each entity has at most one parent.

**network.** A data object consisting of nodes and edges. This object, also known as a graph, is representative of a collection of relationships and entities for a phenomena or set of interacting phenomena.

**node.** An element that connects to edges in a graph.

**occurrent.** An entity that unfolds itself in time.

**ontology.** A hierarchical understanding of defined things that exist in a specified domain of knowledge. A representational artifact of the study of what exists, generally in the form of an enriched taxonomy outlining universal entities, classes, and their relationships.

**property graph.** This type of graph allows each node to connect to an edge, each having multiple properties, ultimately enhancing description of relationships in the knowledge graph.

**schema.** The manner in which data is modeled as objects or relations. A schema often involves explicit structures that dictate key names, value formatting, and datatype constraints with metadata.

**specifically dependent continuants.** Attributes such as qualities, roles, or dispositions: things that describe independent continuants.

**taxonomy.** This term adds order, hierarchy, and ultimately defines how these things relate to one another.

**triples.** The node-edge-node data objects that define relationships in the graph database.

**vertex.** See **node**.
