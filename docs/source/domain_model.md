# Domain Modeling

## Introduction

People build and utilize domains of knowledge in their daily lives. From doing the dishes to reporting at work, complex networks of things interacting with other things are scaled to immense proportions within and between several people, places, and things. The complex state of domain knowledge cannot be understated, but the understanding of how these systems work is paramount. Every relationship in this network starts small and then builds as required by actors in the network. 

It is important to take time in understanding the knowledge to be represented in your domain ontology. From the basic concepts within a discipline to the often complex processes professionals use in those specialized spaces, it is important to engage with the fundamental understanding of how those processes and concepts interact and constitute a domain of applied ontological practice. The modeling of the conceptual domains should show what agents and actants are present in those practices and how their relationships build a clearer picture of a community of practice perpetuating their activities towards expected outcomes.

The conceptual graph should aim to represent explicit and implicit knowledge to the fullest extent possible. The process to elicit this knowledge can be lengthy and tedious, engaging with several subject matter experts (SMEs). These experts, in acknowledgement of the biases and inconsistencies that may emerge, provide critical information regarding the fundamental state and function of their domain of knowledge. These common fundamental states give us a key view into the essential entities and data requisite to define the domain ontology for their community of practices. As a result, the knowledge they express is brought systemically closer to the processes they use while exposing the gaps they fail, in part or whole, to explain.

Knowledge gaps should be clear in your domain ontology. The existence of an entity implies that it can be observed in the real world and denotes that there are epistemological and methodological rationale for it to be expressed through some data state. This state of affairs does not mean that entities should be added in expectation that they will exist at some point, breaking the fundamental purpose of the ontology expression for a domain of knowledge. The ontology should express exactly what does exist for the community of practice and its practioners, making the things that the domain does not address very clear to the viewers. In this way, data state is a key component to consider in the building of a domain ontology with its knowledge gaps.

Building a domain ontology should consider and note what data assets may map to each defined entity. A diagram of the domain ontology should primarily focus on representation of key elements of expert knowledge: things and their processes that represent a holistic network of domain practices. The ultimate intent of this diagraming toward production of knowledge graphs is the alignment of entities to their equivalent data representation. As a result, there should be some initial consideration and indication of what data assets populate each entity within the domain ontology model.

Clear and consistent naming and definition models should be followed throughout the process. The core of this modeling process is contingent upon a consistent and rigorous lexical guide that enforces clear and concise naming conventions. As an ontology grows and then merges with other domains of knowledge, resolving the expanding schemata of names and definitions will be critical to ensure consistent knowledge graph production and data state population of entities. Adherence to lexical guidelines in the beginning of this process will ensure more robust and reproducible modeling practices as your ontology grows.

One final consideration in the modeling of domain knowledge is the lineage of concept to relationship within a knowledge domain. The initial stages of this modeling process will incur several conceptual iterations on the entities, their definitions, and their relationships to other entities in the model. Once concept modelers and subject matter experts are in agreement with the domain representation, it is critical to track any changes to the concepts and their effects on relationships within the domain model. Any breakages in the model, its TLO governance, or the data state population will break the canonical nature of the ontology, making any derivative knowledge graph subject to significant disparities, errors, and speculative biases.

## Challenge

* Recording and resolving concepts and terminology within a domain of knowledge
* Implementing a consistent and rigorous definition system
* Effective expanding class and subclass relationships with their associated data state
* Capture explicit and tacit knowledge from subject matter experts in a community of practice

## Goals

* To capture conceptual model of knowledge domain for a community of practice
* To capture the explicit and tacit knowledge insights of subject matter experts and key actors
* To produce a domain ontology for the domain of knowledge
* To produce an initial schema for the ontology's data state(s)

## Process

This is a multi-stage process that you will revisit several times throughout this standard workflow. Remember to keep it simple and then incrementally improve as you gather and conceptualize the domain of knowledge to be represented logically through valid expert heuristics and functionally through the data state reflecting the entities.

### Requirements

There are several things to consider before starting the conceptual domain modeling phase of this standard. There are qualitative and quantitative methodologies to consider, accesses and permissions, scope and data, and many other factors both general and specific to a domain of knowledge and its expert practioners. Perhaps the first step is to engage with key stakeholders regarding the domain modeling project and its scope. There may be guidance from them on professional contacts, regulatory limitations, and other policies that may improve or restrict the project. This is also the point to identify champions who will support you and your team throughout the domain ontology building process.

Once you have obtained approvals and engaged with key stakeholders, it is prudent to contact SMEs within the domain of knowledge for the modeling project. Experienced professionals in a domain of practice are critical for modeling and data alignment in this standard, so garnering their access and trust are critical for overall success. Be familiar with any language or cultural challenges that may affect expression of their knowledge within the domain model and the ontology. These challenges may require some exposure to foreign language and qualitative methods such as interviews, focus groups, and surveys. Keep in mind that SMEs have years of accumulated experience and a deep knowledge of their work, so it is important to be respectful of their time and attention by being as polite, concise, and accurate in your domain modeling intent as possible.

Throughout these initial steps, it is important to gather each actor's heuristic models: their words, their actions, and their ideas on what exists in their domain of knowledge and practice. The things they mention and their associated processes are at the core of the ontology and graphs you will be building with this standard, so it is imperative that you record and fully comprehend each word, phrase, process, and rule that SMEs observer and leverage in their work. A misalignment of words to data, data to rules, or rules to meaning can severely hamper the usages of a resultant domain ontology or reproduction of a knowledge graph. Retention of the connections between the SME conceptual model, the ontology governance, and the data state should be a primary focus as you complete your initial requirements checklist prior to drafting your initial domain model.

### Defining Domain and Scope

The expression of expert knowledge can be very complex, but the modeling of that knowledge should be simple. This statement does not mean that there is a clear reduction of complex matters into an over simplified collection of entities in a graph, rather it is the shared work of the modelers and the SMEs to break down complex ideas into their most fundamental components capable of expression through a data artifact in a way that does not break class relationships. These ideas will have names, definitions, and rules associated with how they interact with other ideas and the data from how these ideas are observed. Modelers and SMEs must break down these ideas enough to make the model understandable at a meta-level, but not so granular as to be brittle and unusable as the baseline for a knowledge graph. As a result, the effectiveness of the domain model is in finding the balance between essential expressivity and expected computational rigor.

#### Domain Selection

Domain selection is a critical step in the domain ontology process. The modeling effort for an ontology is time intensive and requires a clear understanding of who the model is helping and how the model supports inquiry. Modelers must ask what things and processes do I need to diagram and can these enable queries about the domain of knowledge. The first aspect of selection is in clarity. The initial concept may be too broad or clear to start building a concise ontology. Care must be taken in removing entities which do not need to be modeled to answer any queries required of a connected knowledge graph. Clarity on the domain also aids in deduplication of effort, potentially leveraging other ontology and entity in the modeling of the new ontology.

Alignment to organization goals and key performance indicators (KPIs) is also a key consideration in domain selection. A core aspect of this standard is retention of subject matter expertise which constitutes a lineage of institutional knowledge. As such, it is important to ensure that your work is part of that lineage and that modeling efforts are not wasted on entities that have little or nothing to do with an aspect of the expert domain of knowledge. Engage with the requester or manager associated with the modeling task to ensure the questions and information they need is clearly defined and understood. This dialogue should expand on the context and refine the defined domain to be scoped and modeled in later steps. In many cases, the requestor may require some other resource first before engaging with this process.

Domain selection depends on access to expert knowledge. Once the selection of a domain is made and certain adjustments are complete, ensuring you have access to subject matter experts to aid in refinement of the domain is key. At this stage, the modeler should attempt to assess if experts exist in this domain they plan to model: what kind of experts and to what knowledge do those experts have access? Experts ultimately guide the understanding and definition of knowledge and entities that exist in the real world: methodologically observable and with some level of data artifact. Experts will also have some idea of what data exists in these domains or if data can be collected or generated for use in the knowledge graph.

#### Domain Scope

Establishing the domain scope is a key to ontology model success. Working to establish what entities should and should not exist in the ontology focuses the work of the modelers and the SMEs, making modeling and validation a much simpler and effective process. Modelers and SMEs should work to focus the selected domain into a concise model that sufficiently fulfills all requirements. As the scope of entities grows from one to many with increasing numbers of classes and subclasses, it is important that the collection of entities be sufficiently exhaustive to explain the phenomenon inside of domain knowledge. As such, the scope of the domain must still permit queries needed by users of the ontology and knowledge graphs that result from this standards processes.

#### Top-level Ontology Consideration

cerDO uses a top-level ontology (TLO) approach to knowledge governance. This compliance layer, which we will discuss in the next chapter, enables consistent and rigorous modeling of entities for re-use in ontology and knowledge graph implementations. Without going into the details of a TLO and its application in domain modeling, there are some preliminary considerations to be made in this phase of data ontology building.

Naming conventions matter in ontology work. This aspect of compliance ensures that the names used for each entity are not repeated, misspelled, or misused within and between ontology and graph models. Simple, singular nouns and verbs are preferential in many cases where as noun phrases or compound words can be problematic. You also want to only name entities for which there is instance data. Entities with multiple parents generally happen in application ontology, but must have clear conditions that do not break TLO rules or existing sub-class relationships. An ontology will ultimately guide how entity data will become a knowledge graph and as such needs clear and consistent naming practices to enable additional functionality like testing and reasoning. All these need additional standards or guides to ensure good naming practices (these will be partially addressed in the Appendices).

```{note}
cerDO does not act as a complete lexical standard. In order to persist consistent and rigorous naming practices, another standard may be needed and is highly recommended.
```

Definitions also need careful planning and attention. As a baseline, a definition should capture the sub-class relationship to its parent class. The foundation of this is often an Aristotelian definition, having a clear structure for each entity including its name, the parent class, and a distinguishing feature from the parent class. The model captures hierarchy and connection through the definition, allowing for compact and clear connection of the entity to the greater ontology model.

Metadata requirements are a significant consideration. In addition to TLO compliance, how we store the information about the domain model and the resultant ontology is very important if reuse of the ontology or building of a knowledge graph is a desired outcome. When generating the domain model or processing data in later parts of this standard, a record of transactions should be maintained to know how the data and information around the ontology has changed. Later in the data modeling phase, consolidation of entity data when sub-ontology mappings explain data inheritance is a critical modeling step: the metadata around this ensures this is a valid process.

A system of logic may also be an early consideration when defining a domain. Each entity within the TLO has a set of rules on what does and does not belong to its set. As a result, each domain entity derived from a TLO inherits these rules. In later steps, data will be paired with domain entities. As a result, a series of reasoners is needed to note which consolidated entity uses which rules in a subsequent knowledge graph.

#### Define Key Terms

Each entity has a name, definition, and set of rules that govern its state within an ontology. The name is the most identifiable and used aspect of these entities, aiding in search and distinguishing itself from its subclasses, parent classes, and other similar concepts. Names and their aliases require careful planning as there are nuanced differences within and between communities of practice and between languages. As a result, it is imperative that names and the entities they represent be broken down from complex concepts into their most fundamental things.

Terms should be as simple and common as possible. Term establishment can be challenging, requiring experts to take a granular approach to each entity, its subclasses, and the data state that will represent its existence in the real work. Many entities are comprised of dozens if not hundreds of subclasses, each with their own nuance the makes them unique from their parent and siblings. As such, each name should be simple and reflect this nuance, avoiding any complexity that may confuse of contradict another part of the overall ontology structure.

Names and their associated position and definitions makes term deconfliction a top priority. There will be very similar concepts within an ontology or between several ontologies. It is the job of the SMEs and the ontology specialists to resolve these conflicts where they arise. In many cases, alignment with an associated TLO is sufficient to make initial fixes to terms and definitions. As these ontology grow, there may be a need to leverage more advanced techniques such as novel natural language processing (NLP) or named entity recognition (NER) methodologies to interject resolutions. These deconfliction resolutions, from simple to advanced, provide some level of lineage to enforce backwards compatibility and cross-domain consistency.

Name and definition establishment and resolution can be augmented through tags, labels, and annotations, but should not completely depend on them. Tags, labels, and annotations can cover for qualitative and quantitative ontology or data gaps in lieu of data state during domain definition and scoping, but needs to be resolved before proceeding stages which is why cerDO exists. Aside from these additional metadata tools, the complete core of an entity and its state should be covered in its name, definition, and rules that dictate what it is and is not in the real world.

#### Define Class Hierarchy

Hierarchy in a conceptual domain does not have to be perfect, but it does have to be sufficiently valid to initially appease an ontology expert. Conceptual domain diagrams, with unique names, definitions, and subclass relationships, will be heuristic models established by modelers and SMEs within a domain of knowledge. Many of these unique items will be negotiated and implemented to best reflect how the domain looks, acts, and reacts in the real world to the best of their knowledge. As a result, great care will have to be taken to nest entities and sub-entities within and between each other in the initial stages of this data ontology process.

Top-level ontology systems support domain entity alignment and the domain modeler should be aware of the eventual alignment, but this should not be the primary focus of the domain scoping and building. In the initial stage of negotiating hierarchy, it should start as simply as, "this thing is a type of this other higher-order thing of which it has this distinct property." The initial result of this should be a rough, emergent hierarchy of entity classes associated with key aspects of a domain of knowledge.

#### Define Class Properties and Facets

Once the modeler has final feedback from SMEs and champions of this process, then initial property tagging of the entities for alignment to a TLO system is possible, but should not be considered the start to the TLO compliance phase of this standard: this is just a small part of the metadata footprint for the entity model and its association with the TLO and the ultimate data model to which it will be married. As a result, there are several property and facet decisions to be made before completing the initial domain model.

When gathering information and scoping the domain model, considerations of data sources and constraints must be established. This establishment is not of a final property system to assist in metadata generation, rather an initial consideration of how metadata can best enable consistent and rigorous use of the domain model, the resultant ontology, and the data assets that assist in knowledge graph generation. This association between domain model and its utility makes schema and range key considerations.

Each entity will have both TLO-associated characteristics and instance-level characteristics. With the TLO considerations covered in the next section and the instance data considerations covered in the last, it will suffice to say here that an initial consideration on what data should be a part of each entity is critical in making it usable. The data type and values that constitute the baseline of schema for the underlying data assets is a key part of validating the canonical nature of the ontology. This aspect of the domain scope intimately connects the data to scale and shape of the domain, the result of which is the established range of the queries which can be performed at the instance level of any derivative knowledge graph.

Consideration of range extends to the application of TLO and logic as governance over the domain model. There is a strand of logic that links the axiomatic logic of the abstract TLO entities, the domain entities, and the manifestation of their real world observations in data. The manner in which we link these together and document their lineage of evolution through metadata matters. The fundamental practices embedding the establishment of domain knowledge, its relationships, and the governance mechanisms within a metadata model and schemata are key artifacts from this portion of the standard process. As a result, the logic system must also be amendable to integrating with this mode of documentation and access.

#### Scope Instances

Instantiation of domain models through data is the ultimate goal of this standard and its modular process. At this stage in the standard, this consideration should be a sanity check to ensure that the scoping of domain model instantiation is possible. The modeler and the SMEs should have an idea of what data assets should be mined, collected, requested, or generated to make the utilization of the domain model possible for users. The data instances should reflect the entities based on previously established properties, rules, and relationships. In examining the available and scoped instances derived from the domain entity model, the domain should clearly dictate the data instances to be used within the model. Care should be taken at this stage to ensure that data modeling is indeed possible at later stages in this standard.

### Defining Schema

Following the establishment of the domain model and its scope including a metadata model, entity model, and TLO-alignment plan, an initial schema should be drafted to establish the link between the domain model and the data architecture that will support its use. There are several ways in which a domain model can be represented, accessed, and used to answer question within a domain of knowledge. Drafting a schema based on the known scale, range, size, and complexity of the domain model will help in building a data engineering solution that supports it sustained use. The information including data sources, data types, and query requirements will aid in overall drafting of the schema and the implementation layer to be built in its support.

## Key Challenges

There are several challenges associated with building conceptual models and domain ontology models.

* Care and planning must be taken to scope the optimal number of entities within a model. Based on the total number of entities and the total number of nested subclasses, the number of potential relationships to be generated in a given graph could be massive. Understanding the connection between the size of the domain model and the scale of the underlying data would avoid challenges in utilization of these models.
* Multiple inheritance, often a case where an instance inherits from more than one parent, is problematic for domain models. If not properly scoped, this condition can break TLO governance and make axiomatic reasoning problematic.
* Extensibility of the domain model post TLO-alignment may be challenging. The addition of new entities is necessary for domain models as knowledge expands within that domain. However, the addition of new subclasses and the underlying data may lead to conflicts such as re-use of data state and duplication of instances through misalignment of entity to data. This may be further complicated as new domain entities my violated TLO hierarchy and rules, breaking many axiomatic expressions within the domain model itself.
