# FAQ

## What is cerDO?

cerDO is the Certus data ontology standard: developed for connecting data to real-world concepts.

## How does cerDO work?

cerDO is simple: experts map their domain ontology model, align their model entities with a top-level ontology, and then consistently load data into the domain ontology model.

## Who is cerDO for?

Data professionals and researchers seeking an intuitive and effective model for building domain knowledge for their data assets and metadata information.

## When should I not use cerDO?

cerDO can be used in a modular manner: experts and specialist can create their domain models to better understand their data requirements. However, a data management system should be in place prior to applying cerDO as consistent and rigorous data assets are critical for this standard's effectiveness.
If you are in need of a data management system, [ciuTshi](https://certusgroup.org/ciutshi/) is a good place to start.
