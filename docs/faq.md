# FAQ

## What is cerDO?

cerDO is the Certus data ontology standard: developed for connecting data to real-world concepts.

## How does cerDO work?

cerDO is simple: experts map their domain model, align their model entities with a top-level ontology, and then consistently load data into derivative, mid-level domain ontology objects.

## Who is cerDO for?

Data professionals and researchers seeking an intuitive and effective model for building domain knowledge for their data assets and metadata information.

## When should I not use cerDO?

cerDO can be used in a modular manner: experts and specialist can create their domain ontology to better understand their data requirements. However, a data management system should be in place prior to applying cerDO as consistent and rigorous data assets are critical for this standard's effectiveness.
If you are in need of a data management standard, [ciuTshi](https://ciutshi.certuscore.com/) is a good place to start.

## Are there any diagrams to explain cerDO?

Diagrams are coming in the next minor release along with a legend and other visual aids to explain the standard and its methods.

## Are there any examples of this standard being applied to knowledge graphs, structured, or unstructured data products?

There are appendices with examples coming in the next minor release to demonstrate the standard's application for several data products.
